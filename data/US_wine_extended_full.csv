22366,US,"This is another fantastic vintage of this Zinfandel, blended smaller amounts of Mourv猫dre and Petite Sirah. It offers a wealth of soft, juicy milk chocolate and cherry pie character and is high in acidity and dusty tannin.

84091,US,"Smoke and dark chocolate notes abound on this elegant Long Island Merlot (made with 10% Petit Verdot).

128384,US,"Always in the top rank of Oregon Chardonnays, the Sigrid expresses itself with voluptuously ripe fruits, a generous mix of apples, peaches and pears.

87547,US,"All six Bordeaux grapes make an appearance in this well-oaked spicebox of a red. It's just plain delicious, from the first sniff on through.
